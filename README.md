# **AUTOMATIC GENERATION OF MEDICAL IMAGING REPORTS**

Medical images, such as radiology and pathology images, are widely used in hospitals for the diagnosis and treatment of many diseases, such as pneumonia and pneumothorax. The reading and interpretation of medical images are usually conducted by specialized medical professionals. For less-experienced radiologists and pathologists, especially those working in the rural area where the quality of healthcare is relatively low, writing medical-imaging reports is demanding. This motivates us to investigate whether it is possible to automatically generate medical image reports.

We aim to create an end to end solution for the problem of writing **medical reports from medical images**. Creating medical reports from images such as XRays and other scans may be error prone and tedious. ***AGMIR*** shall allow medical practitioners to automatically generate medical reports and also organize them effectively. We use a *multilabel classifier* to predict the tag to every part of the image and then an *LSTM based sentence model* to generate descriptions for the tags. 
The project borrows it's idea from the research paper **On the Automatic generation of medical reports** : https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08195
